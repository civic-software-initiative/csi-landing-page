      Meet Nikhil
    </h3>
    Nikhil serves on the CSI board and acts as a member of the engineering team, designing and building the solutions that best fit each client’s unique needs.
    He began his software career at Amazon, but pivoted to the startup world where he took products from prototype to production in the healthcare, finance, and insurance industries.
    His work leading volunteer efforts to scale local food bank data pipelines and build user-friendly web apps to solve pandemic challenges led naturally to his role at CSI. Outside of work, Nikhil likes to go hiking on Mt. Hood with his dog, Koda!
